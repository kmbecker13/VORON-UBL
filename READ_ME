Hello!  Welcome to the VORON Unified Bed Leveling firmware repo.  

The files you find here are my attempt at merging VORON firmware with the new Marlin UBL Dev branch.

There are currently two main folders:
1) VORON_12inch_Volume <-- This is meant for my personal VORON with a 300 x 300 x 230mm build volume
2) VORON_Stock_Volume <-- This is meant for those using a stock VORON build.

The ONLY changes between these two folders is the Configuration.h file, which has been changed for the different build areas.

I have chosen to place all files in each folder to reduce confusion on how it should work.
