//	This code is an alternate implementation of the Least Squares Best Fit algorythm that
//	is used to calculate the plane the print bed lies in.   It is an optional replacement for the
//	more proven and much larger QR_SOLVE code base that is being used in the Marlin Code base.
//
//	Using this code as a solution for the Least Squares Best fit by the Auto Bed Leveling code
//	will save you almost exactly 10 Kb of firmware space.   It will cost you several seconds of
//	time after all the points are sampled as it iteratively converges on a Least Squares Error
//	solution for the plane.
